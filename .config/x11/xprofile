# HiDPI displays may require DPI adjustment to be more comfortable to read.
# If it is the case adjust it below using device's hostname or just use a value determined by X Server.
# There are also two things to bear in mind:
#  1) xrandr sets the X Server DPI but there is also the font DPI that can be set using Xft.dpi in a file
#     loaded by xrdb (e.g. i3wm reads this property).
#  2) Some applications may still use its own DPI configuration.
