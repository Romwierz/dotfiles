# Automate pulling git repos after log in.
#
# This unit uses `notify-send` which needs notification daemon to work. 
#
# Notification daemon is `dunst` in this case and it has its own service under systemd.
#
# If 'Requires=' was used instead of 'Wants=' and this unit would be tried to be started
# before dunst.service, it would result in the dependency failure.
